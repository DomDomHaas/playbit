# Playbit
Playbit is framework for creating cross-platform Playdate games from a single Lua codebase. To accomplish this, it has two key components
* A reimplemention the Playdate API in Love2D.
* A build system that utilizes a [preprocessor](https://github.com/ReFreezed/LuaPreprocess/) to strip/inject platform dependent code.

**âš  IMPORTANT:** This project is in active development and has not reached a stable 1.0 release yet. Use in a production environment at your own risk. 

## Current Features
* Partial reimplementation of Playdate API in Love2D
* Custom build scripts
* Custom preprocessor flags
* Export [Aseprite (.aseprite)](https://www.aseprite.org/) files at build-time
* Convert [Caps](https://play.date/caps/) fonts to [BMFonts](https://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/) at build-time
* Custom build-time file processors
* Macro support (via LuaPreprocess's [macros](http://luapreprocess.refreezed.com/docs/extra-functionality/#insert-func))
* Compile asserts out for release builds (via LuaPreprocess's [ASSERT() macro](http://luapreprocess.refreezed.com/docs/api/#assert))
